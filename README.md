# RotationTracker
Python application to rotate through different classroom activities.

In an effort to model a self-paced structure I have devised the following rotation.

  * 15 minutes of Distraction Free time
  * 5 minutes of Question/Discussion time
  * 10 minutes of Flex Time
  
## Distraction Free
Students must be working on academic work and I (the teacher) will NOT answer questions.
The goal is to have students try and work through problems on their own building resiliance and all of the self-(insert word here) things.
The teachers only job during this period is to keep the students on task and keep the room quite.

## Question/Discussion
Students ask the questions they came up with during the distraction free time.
The idea is that the students should be able to answer and discuss the answers themselves without my input.
However if needed I'll answer or direct the conversation as needed.

## Flex Time
This is the time students have to themselves, they can watch videos, listen to music, socialize with others.
Students must respect those that are trying to continue working by not distracting them.
The teachers job is to answer any other questions and check in with the students.
